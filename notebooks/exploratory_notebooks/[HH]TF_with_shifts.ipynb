The X-axis represents the pulse transmission time, also known as “slow-time”. The Y-axis represents the reception time of signals with respect to pulse transmission time divided into 128 equal sized bins, also known as “fast-time”. The reason FFT is performed on the ‘fast time’ axis (i.e. 128 samples) rather than on the ‘slow time’ axis (i.e. 32 samples) is a matter of scale. An underlying assumption for an effective FFT analysis is that ‘acceleration’ during the time frame represented by the data is very low. Given the type of motion presented by humans and animals only the ‘fast time’ axis complies with this assumption.\n","Therefore, FFT processing should be applied over the dimension of 128 I/Q time samples to get the frequency content of the returned radar signal at each time frame. A spectrogram (as shown in the samples) is generated by attaching together 32 consecutive FFT results (please note that besides FFT processing some additional manipulation is required to properly display a spectrogram – like taking a LOG of the absolute value and passing a threshold – this is well detailed in the ‘Processing’ section of the competition notebook). Therefore, a spectrogram would eventually provide a display of how the frequency content of the returned signal is changing along time."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"colab_type":"text","id":"-j6KvZouVfP6"},"source":["### **Splitting the Training set**\n","\n","The functions below split the training set into Train and Validation sets.\n","\n","* Validation Set.   \n","The validation set is constructed from segments from geolocation_ids 1 and 4.   \n","These geolocations' target_type distributions are balanced.\n","To create a fair representation of the test set   \n","(one segment form each track) every sixth segment was taken to the validation set.   \n","The reason is that approximately 75% of the tracks have less than 6 segments (see the [Descriptive Statistics notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/11Lzihg2vKIbo4KAIIJxW5CRZIncoWgtL?usp=sharing)),   \n","it guarantees that most of the segments in the validation set are not from the same track.   \n","   \n","* Adding \"human\" segments to the training set.   \n","The training set is imbalanced (more animals than humans, see the [Descriptive Statistics notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/11Lzihg2vKIbo4KAIIJxW5CRZIncoWgtL?usp=sharing).   \n","One can address this issue by taking segements of humans from the \"Auxiliary Experiment Set\".   \n","The first 3 segments from each track are taken into the training set (or less if the track is shorter than 3 segments)."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"colab_type":"text","id":"ByTli3H1VfQD"},"source":["## **Training The Model**"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab_type":"code","id":"xqdUzjrN-U6f","tags":[],"colab":{}},"source":["# Loading and preparing the data\n","\n","# Loading Auxiliary Experiment set - can take a few minutes\n","experiment_auxiliary = 'MAFAT RADAR Challenge - Auxiliary Experiment Set V2'\n","experiment_auxiliary_df = get_data.load_data(experiment_auxiliary, folder=data_path )\n","experiment_auxiliary_df['date_index'].shape\n","print(f\"experiment_auxiliary dataset shape: {experiment_auxiliary_df['date_index'].shape}\")\n","\n","# Taking sample from the Auxiliary Experiment set\n","train_aux = get_data.aux_split(experiment_auxiliary_df)\n","train_aux['date_index'].shape\n","print(f\"train_aux shape: {train_aux['date_index'].shape}\")\n","\n","##############\n","# Training set\n","##############\n","\n","train_path = 'MAFAT RADAR Challenge - Training Set V1'\n","training_df = get_data.load_data(train_path, folder=data_path )\n","print(f\"real dataset({training_df['date_index'].shape})\",end='')\n","\n","# Adding segments from the experiment auxiliary set to the training set\n","train_df = get_data.append_dict(training_df, train_aux)\n","print(f\" + aux dataset({train_aux['date_index'].shape}) = full train({train_df['date_index'].shape})\")\n","\n","# Preprocessing and split the data to training and validation\n","train_df = specto_feat.data_preprocess(train_df.copy())\n","train_x, train_y, val_x, val_y, is_validation_ar = get_data.split_train_val(train_df)\n","\n","train_df_t = train_df.copy()\n","del train_df_t['doppler_burst']\n","del train_df_t['iq_sweep_burst']\n","train_dff = pd.DataFrame(train_df_t)\n","train_dff['is_validation']=is_validation_ar\n","\n","val_y =  val_y.astype(int)\n","train_y =train_y.astype(int)\n","train_x = train_x.reshape(list(train_x.shape)+[1])\n","val_x = val_x.reshape(list(val_x.shape)+[1])\n","\n","print(f\"train only:{train_x.shape[0]}.  val only:{val_x.shape[0]}\")\n"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab_type":"code","id":"V3qP6qsemv2p","tags":[],"colab":{}},"source":["# generate shifts and merge them into the training set only\n","# preprocessing was already done on data!
