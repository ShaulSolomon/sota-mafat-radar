Set max value on the center of the target's mass.   \n","The doppler burst is a vector (1 x 32) that marks the center of the target's mass on each I/Q matrix in every time unit (32 time-units).   \n","The preprocess sets the maximum value of each I/Q matrix in-place of the values at the center of the target's mass.\n","3. Normalization - Transforming I/Q matrix values to standardized values.   \n","Subtraction of the mean and division by the standard deviation.\n","\n","**Preprocessing main steps explained:**   \n","The DFT converts a signal from its original domain (often time or space) to a representation in the frequency domain and vice versa.   \n","The I/Q matrix in this challenge is being converted from the velocity domain to the frequency domain.\n","Windows (like \"Hann\") are used to reduce spectral leakage when performing a Fourier Transform on time data and converting it into the frequency domain.\n","\n","The purpose of switching the values of the center of the target's mass in the I/Q matrix with the max value of the matrix is to enhance this part of the matrix and focus the model on this part.\n","\n","\n","Finally, the normalization is used for scaling all the I/Q matrices.\n","\n","* *Note: the target_type lables are strings (\"human\" and \"animal\"), the data_preprocess function replaces them to \"human\" = 1 and \"animal\" = 0.*   \n","   \n","\n","\n","**The FFT Process Explained:**   \n","The IQ matrix contains 32 x 128 elements being 128 I/Q time data samples within a single radar processing time frame and 32 consecutive such time units. The X-axis represents the pulse transmission time, also known as “slow-time”. The Y-axis represents the reception time of signals with respect to pulse transmission time divided into 128 equal sized bins, also known as “fast-time”. The reason FFT is performed on the ‘fast time’ axis (i.e. 128 samples) rather than on the ‘slow time’ axis (i.e. 32 samples) is a matter of scale. An underlying assumption for an effective FFT analysis is that ‘acceleration’ during the time frame represented by the data is very low. Given the type of motion presented by humans and animals only the ‘fast time’ axis complies with this assumption.\n","Therefore, FFT processing should be applied over the dimension of 128 I/Q time samples to get the frequency content of the returned radar signal at each time frame. A spectrogram (as shown in the samples) is generated by attaching together 32 consecutive FFT results (please note that besides FFT processing some additional manipulation is required to properly display a spectrogram – like taking a LOG of the absolute value and passing a threshold – this is well detailed in the ‘Processing’ section of the competition notebook). Therefore, a spectrogram would eventually provide a display of how the frequency content of the returned signal is changing along time."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"-j6KvZouVfP6","colab_type":"text"},"source":["### **Splitting the Training set**\n","\n","The functions below split the training set into Train and Validation sets.\n","\n","* Validation Set.   \n","The validation set is constructed from segments from geolocation_ids 1 and 4.   \n","These geolocations' target_type distributions are balanced.\n","To create a fair representation of the test set   \n","(one segment form each track) every sixth segment was taken to the validation set.   \n","The reason is that approximately 75% of the tracks have less than 6 segments (see the [Descriptive Statistics notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/11Lzihg2vKIbo4KAIIJxW5CRZIncoWgtL?usp=sharing)),   \n","it guarantees that most of the segments in the validation set are not from the same track.   \n","   \n","* Adding \"human\" segments to the training set.   \n","The training set is imbalanced (more animals than humans, see the [Descriptive Statistics notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/11Lzihg2vKIbo4KAIIJxW5CRZIncoWgtL?usp=sharing).   \n","One can address this issue by taking segements of humans from the \"Auxiliary Experiment Set\".   \n","The first 3 segments from each track are taken into the training set (or less if the track is shorter than 3 segments)."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"170f5Pcgk5gF","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## **Model**"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"QrGpOOCGgVdz","colab_type":"text"},"source":["### **CNN Model**\n","The model has two convolutional layers, both followed by max-pooling layers.    \n","Those layers are followed by 2 fully-connected (dense) layers, activated with a ReLU function and regularized with   \n","L2 regularization, followed by a final output layer with a single neuron with a Sigmoid activation function,   \n","used for final binary classification."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"Fm-o5mr6gT7i","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["# Building the model\n","def create_model(input_shape, init):\n","  \"\"\"\n","  CNN model.\n","\n","  Arguments:\n","    input_shape -- the shape of our input\n","    init -- the weight initialization\n","\n","  Returns:\n","    CNN model    \n","  \"\"\"\n","  model = Sequential()\n","  model.add(Conv2D(16, kernel_size=(3, 3), activation='relu', kernel_initializer = init, bias_regularizer='l2', input_shape=input_shape))\n","  model.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)))\n","  model.add(Conv2D(32, kernel_size=(3, 3), activation='relu', kernel_initializer = init, bias_regularizer='l2'))\n","  model.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)))\n","  model.add(Flatten())\n","  model.add(Dense(128, kernel_regularizer = 'l2', activation='relu', kernel_initializer = init))\n","  model.add(Dense(32, kernel_regularizer = 'l2', activation='relu', kernel_initializer = init))\n","  model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid', kernel_initializer = init))\n","  return model"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"q6VRmYQ6VfP_","colab_type":"text"},"source":["### **Evaluation and Visualization of Model's results**"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ByTli3H1VfQD","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## **Training The Model**"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"CKvhQs_9gpVN","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["# Loading and preparing the data\n","\n","# Loading Auxiliary Experiment set -
